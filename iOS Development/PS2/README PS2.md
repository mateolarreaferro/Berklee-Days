7. Purpose:
The purpose of this problem set is divided into two parts: 1. It was to experiment with playground in order to learn the syntax, declare variables, use for loops and print functions. 2. It was also to experiment with UI, audio in mobile apps, constrains, and the relationship between UI and code.

8. Description:

Problem Set 2.1 consisted in declarin an int, float and string in the playground.
Problem Set 2.2 consisted in printing an array of integers using a for loop. 
PS2.3.xcodeproj consists in creating 4 different buttoms that change the color/play sound
